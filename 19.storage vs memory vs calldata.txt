                    19.storage vs memory vs calldata

storage
    It is where all state variables are stored. 
    Because state can be altered in a contract (for example, within a function), 
    storage variables must be mutable. 
    However, their location is persistent, 
    and they are stored on the blockchain. 


 memory
    Memory is reserved for variables that are defined within the scope of a function.                      

calldata
    Calldata is an immutable, temporary location where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory.


pragma solidity ^0.8.7;

contract Storage{

    //store the data in storage(block chain)
    string public text;


    function set(string calldata _text) external view{
        text = _text
    }
}

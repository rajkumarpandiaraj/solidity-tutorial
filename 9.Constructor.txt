                        9.Constructor


A constructor is an optional function that is executed upon contract creation.
Constructor is the function called only once,
When the smart contract is deployed.
It is mainly used to initialize the StateVariable

pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

// Base contract X
contract X {
    string public name;

    constructor(string _name) {
        name = _name;
    }

}

remix excepts constructor input while deployingthe function.

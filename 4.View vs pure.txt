                        4.View vs pure


view Vs pure
    --> both are not able to add or modify the block.
    --> but view function can read the data from the blockChain(State Variable)
    --> pure function cannot read data from the blockChain


  Example   

    pragma solidity ^0.8.7

    contract ViewAndPureFunction{

        uint public num = 10;

        function viewFunc() external view returns(uint){

            //can read the state Variable
            return num;
        }

        function viewFunc() external pure returns(uint){
            //can't read the state Variable
            return 1;
        }
    }

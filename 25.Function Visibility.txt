                        25.Visibility


Visibility :

    private -->  only inside the contract not outside the contract.
    internal -->  only inside the contract and itâ€™s child contract.
    public --> only inside the contract and outside the contract
    external --> only from outside the contract (other contracts).
            there is an hack to call the external functio0n inside the same contract using this keyword
                let assume foo is a external function
                in the other function inside the same contract we can call the foo function using this keyword like this
                    this.foo()
                    But this is gas ineffecient, so don't do that

This are applicable for both function and variables

Self Destruct:

Contracts can be deleted from the blockchain by calling selfdestruct.

selfdestruct sends all remaining Ether stored in the contract to a designated address.

Vulnerability
A malicious contract can use selfdestruct to force sending Ether to any contract.


// selfdestruct 
    -- Deletes Contract
    -- sends the ether to some contract withput having the fallback or receive


Example :

    pragms solidity ^0.8.10;

    contract Kill{
        constructor() payable {};

        function kill() external {
            selfdestruct(payable(msg.sender));
        }
    }

    contract Helper {
        function getBalanace() external view returns(uint) {
            retrn address(this).balance;
        }

        function kill(Kill _kill) external {
            _kill.kill()
        }
    }

                    34.new way of deploying one Contract from other


Contracts can be created by other contracts using the new keyword.
Since 0.8.0, new keyword supports create2 feature by specifying salt options.


Example:
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

contract Car {
    address public owner;
    string public model;
    address public carAddr;

    constructor(address _owner, string memory _model) payable {
        owner = _owner;
        model = _model;
        carAddr = address(this);
    }
}

contract CarFactory {
    Car[] public cars;

    function create(address _owner, string memory _model) public {
        //new Car() deploys the contract
        Car car = new Car(_owner, _model);
        cars.push(car);
    }

    function createAndSendEther(address _owner, string memory _model) public payable {
        Car car = (new Car){value: msg.value}(_owner, _model);
        cars.push(car);
    }
}
